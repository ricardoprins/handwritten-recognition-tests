Tests for HRTs - mostly in Portuguese


This is going to be a long-term project. Initially, I'm gathering volunteers to have a dataset in Portuguese.

Then, I'll create a model using pytorch with this dataset, and run a few tests in some handwritten passenger lists.

I might try to use some other datasets (there's one with names on Kaggle - if I figure out a way of having just the names extracted from the lists - which isn
't exactly easy with the images I currently have) in the future.
